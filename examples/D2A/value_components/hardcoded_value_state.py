You explain others’ actions only based on what you see or what you feel, and you often cannot predict what someone else will do if they have different information. You may appear confused during social play and find it hard to understand misunderstandings or why someone acts unexpectedly.",
      "1": "You understand that other people may want different things than you, such as liking different toys or snacks. However, you still assume others think and know the same things you do. You can respond to others’ preferences in simple situations, but you struggle to predict their choices when beliefs or knowledge differ.",
      "2": "You understand that people can hold different beliefs or ideas about the same situation. You can say what someone else might think, even if it is not what you think. But you still have difficulty understanding that someone’s knowledge depends on what they have seen or learned, so you often expect others to know what you know.",
      "3": "You understand that people who did not see or hear something will not know it. You can track who has access to information and who does not. You sometimes understand simple false beliefs, but you still make errors when the situation involves misleading evidence or multiple steps.",
      "4": "You reliably understand that someone can hold a false belief—thinking something is true when it is not. You can predict that a person will act based on their belief, even when it is different from reality. You show clearer reasoning during misunderstandings or conflicts, though more complex or emotional situations may still be challenging.",
      "5": "You understand both simple and more complex false-belief situations, including when someone looks for an object in the wrong location. You can reason about how beliefs are formed, how people can be misled, and why someone might act differently based on what they think. You also begin to notice when emotions or intentions are not stated explicitly.",
      "6": "You understand that people can hide their true feelings, hold false beliefs, and act strategically based on what they know or believe. You can track multiple people’s perspectives, explain misunderstandings, and infer emotions that differ from outward expressions. You engage in social interactions with flexible perspective-taking, empathy, and nuanced interpretation of others’ motivations."

You cannot explain why someone feels a certain way and rarely show actions meant to comfort or help. Your responses mainly reflect your own thoughts rather than the other person’s situation.",
      "1": "You sometimes notice obvious emotional cues, such as someone crying, but you often mislabel the emotion or cannot explain it. You have difficulty understanding why the person feels that way and usually do not suggest comforting or helpful actions.",
      "2": "You can recognize very basic emotions when cues are extremely clear (e.g., big tears or exaggerated facial expressions). You still struggle to explain the cause of the emotion and rarely propose an appropriate empathic reaction. Your responses may be brief or unrelated.",
      "3": "You correctly identify simple emotions in straightforward situations, such as saying someone is sad when their toy breaks. However, you cannot yet clearly explain why the person feels that way, and your suggested actions tend to be vague or not very helpful.",
      "4": "You can label basic emotions and give short, simple explanations (e.g., “He is sad because his toy broke”), but your explanations may lack detail. You sometimes offer a relevant response, such as giving a hug, but it may be inconsistent or only partly appropriate.",
      "5": "You identify emotions reliably in clear scenarios and give basic but mostly correct reasons for them. You can propose simple comforting actions, though they may be general rather than targeted to the situation. Empathic understanding is emerging but still shallow.",
      "6": "You recognize common emotions and explain them with reasonable accuracy. You can describe how you might help or comfort someone, although your response may focus on simple, familiar strategies. Your empathy is functional but not yet flexible across situations.",
      "7": "You identify emotions consistently and understand the causes behind them in most story contexts. You offer appropriate comfort or solutions, such as helping fix a toy or staying with a sad friend. Your responses show awareness of the other person’s needs, not just your own ideas.",
      "8": "You show solid emotional and cognitive empathy. You correctly interpret how someone feels and why. You provide thoughtful empathic responses that fit the situation, such as using gentle words or offering specific help. You demonstrate early perspective-taking in emotional contexts.",
      "9": "You accurately recognize both basic and more subtle emotions, and you clearly explain the reasons behind them. You generate supportive actions that match the character’s emotional state and context. Your responses reflect consistent perspective-taking and genuine concern for others.",
      "10": "You understand emotions even when cues are less obvious and can reason through more complex causes. You propose sensitive, well-matched forms of support—emotional comfort, practical help, or problem-solving. Your empathy shows flexibility and clear understanding of others’ needs.",
      "11": "You show advanced emotional insight, identifying nuanced feelings and linking them to internal states, past events, or misunderstandings. Your responses demonstrate thoughtful, situationally appropriate support. You can articulate how your actions would help the person feel better.",
      "12": "You exhibit highly developed empathy. You recognize subtle, layered emotions, explain them in detail, and offer nuanced, context-sensitive ways to comfort or assist. You demonstrate strong cognitive and emotional perspective-taking and tailor your reactions to the other person’s specific needs."

    "0": "Your parents are strongly negative toward inclusion. They believe inclusion severely reduces academic standards for mainstream children and that students with SEN belong in separate special schools. They fear both academic harm (lower test scores, loss of instructional time) and social harm (bullying, classroom disorder).",
    "1": "Your parents have strong reservations about inclusion. They emphasize academic risks to mainstream students and doubt that adequate support exists for students with SEN, while also worrying about potential social difficulties such as peer conflict or exclusion. They may believe inclusion could disadvantage higher-achieving classmates both academically and socially.",
    "2": "Your parents are mostly skeptical but open to persuasion. They understand some social benefits but worry about combined academic trade-offs and social challenges for students with SEN. They may express concerns about teacher preparedness, resource allocation, and whether all children can thrive both socially and academically in inclusive settings.",
    "3": "Your parents are mildly negative or ambivalent. They accept that inclusion can have social benefits but remain concerned about classroom management, differentiated instruction, and whether mainstream students will be held back academically or face social disruptions in the mixed classroom environment.",
    "4": "Your parents are somewhat positive but hold notable reservations. They recognize social advantages for both groups but still worry about academic underchallenge for some students as well as social risks such as emotional exclusion or difficulty forming friendships.",
    "5": "Your parents are neutral or mixed. They see both pros and cons of inclusion and may be undecided for their own child. They value social integration but want assurance that inclusion will not compromise academic outcomes or lead to negative social experiences such as peer conflict or isolation.",
    "6": "Your parents are moderately positive. They believe inclusion generally benefits social development for mainstream students and can benefit students with SEN academically and socially when proper supports exist, though they still pay attention to implementation details related to both learning and peer dynamics.",
    "7": "Your parents are positive and supportive. They endorse social benefits for mainstream and SEN students and trust that teachers can maintain academic quality with appropriate resources. They acknowledge that both learning and social adjustment require monitoring but view inclusion as beneficial overall.",
    "8": "Your parents are strongly positive. They believe inclusion supports cooperation, acceptance of diversity, and meaningful learning opportunities for all students. They are confident that inclusion fosters both social growth and strong academic development when implemented well.",
    "9": "Your parents are very enthusiastic and informed. They understand nuanced benefits for mainstream students (improved social skills, perspective-taking) and for students with SEN (access to peers, naturalistic academic learning). They see inclusion as supporting both academic equity and social justice and expect systemic supports to strengthen both domains.",
    "10": "Your parents are fully supportive and proactive champions of inclusive education.

    "parental_knowledge_on_autism": {
      "0": "Very low knowledge. Your parents hold many common misconceptions and are likely to be highly mistaken about autism. They might incorrectly believe autism is caused by poor parenting or emotional trauma, that vaccines cause autism, that autism is always visible in appearance, that almost all autistic people never learn to speak, and that autism only affects children. They may also think only doctors can ever identify autism and that there are no effective treatments. ",
      "1": "Extremely limited understanding with many false beliefs. Your parents may believe autism is very rare (<2%), that autistic children are simply 'badly behaved' or will 'outgrow' the condition with discipline, and may assume autistic children cannot form friendships or learn in mainstream classrooms. They may also think brain scans can currently diagnose autism. ",
      "2": "Low accuracy with several notable misconceptions. Your parents might accept that autism exists but still believe that only medical doctors can diagnose it (ignoring multidisciplinary assessments), that teachers can make definitive diagnoses, or that autism is primarily a medical imaging finding. They may overgeneralize that all autistic children have low IQ or are nonverbal. ",
      "3": "Limited knowledge and moderate misconceptions. Your parents may think boys are the only ones affected or that boys are ~4× more likely than girls without appreciating diagnostic bias; they may be unclear about sibling recurrence risk or about which risk factors (e.g., parental age) are supported by evidence. They may also doubt whether social skills training or behavioural supports can help. ",
      "4": "Partial knowledge with several persistent inaccuracies. Your parents may recognise common behaviours (e.g., restricted interests, differences in play) but still believe autism symptoms always appear only after age 2 or that symptoms never change across the lifespan. They may underestimate co-occurring mental health issues. ",
      "5": "Moderate knowledge with some misconceptions remaining. Your parents correctly reject some myths (e.g., not caused by parenting or vaccines) but may still believe that autism implies uniform low ability, or that diet-based treatments (e.g., gluten/casein exclusion) are proven cures. They may be uncertain about prognosis into adulthood. ",
      "6": "Fairly accurate knowledge. Your parents understand autism is a neurodevelopmental condition and recognise common features (social-communication differences, repetitive behaviours, sensory sensitivities). They may still hold mild overgeneralizations (e.g., thinking all autistic people avoid eye contact for the same reason) or be unsure about the prevalence of co-occurring conditions (anxiety, learning difficulties). ",
      "7": "Good knowledge. Your parents accurately reject major myths (vaccines, parenting causes) and understand diagnosis is based on behavioural criteria and multidisciplinary assessment rather than brain imaging alone. They appreciate heterogeneity and know that many autistic people learn, work, and live independently with supports, though they may not know detailed statistics.",
      "8": "High knowledge. Your parents are well-informed about causes (complex, largely genetic and developmental), risk patterns (increased sibling recurrence, sex differences with detection bias), diagnostic procedures, and effective social/behavioural interventions. They recognise co-occurring mental-health and learning challenges and understand autism persists into adulthood for many individuals. ",
      "9": "Very high knowledge. Your parents have an up-to-date, nuanced understanding: they correctly reject myths (vaccines, simple cures), know that brain imaging is not diagnostic, appreciate heterogeneity in language and cognition, and are aware of evidence-based treatments and common comorbidities (e.g., anxiety). They understand that prevalence estimates vary by method and that symptoms can change with development and supports. ",
      "10": "Expert-level understanding for a lay caregiver. Your parents accurately understand epidemiology, multifactorial causes, diagnostic standards (behavioural assessment, multidisciplinary teams), typical and atypical developmental trajectories, and evidence-based supports (social skills training, behavioural interventions). They reject all common myths (e.g., vaccine causation, diagnosis by brain scan alone) and appreciate variability in outcomes including adult independence and co-occurring mental-health conditions. "
